## Installation 🛠️

### Prerequisites

Before you start installing **Solid Disco**, make sure you have the following:

- **Basic Electronics Knowledge**: Understanding of circuits, LED strips, and music-reactive components.
- **Hardware Components**:
  - LED lights or smart lighting (RGB or addressable LEDs)
  - Speakers or audio system
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
  - Power supply for LEDs and music system
  - Disco ball (optional but adds flair!)
  - Motion sensors or floor pressure sensors (for interactive dance floor)
- **Software**: Code libraries for controlling LEDs and audio integration (e.g., FastLED for LEDs, Open Sound Control for music).
- **Tools**: Soldering iron, wires, connectors, and basic hand tools for assembly.

### Steps to Install

1. **Assemble the Lights**:
   - Set up your LED strips in the area where you want the lights to shine. Ensure they are evenly distributed for maximum effect.
   - Connect the LED strips to your microcontroller, following wiring diagrams for your specific setup.

2. **Install the Audio System**:
   - Set up your speakers or audio system to play music. Connect them to the microcontroller or sound-reactive hardware.
   - Make sure your audio source (e.g., music player or smartphone) can sync with the system.

3. **Set Up the Disco Ball (Optional)**:
   - Install the disco ball in the center of your space, ensuring it’s securely mounted and can rotate if desired.
   - Use reflective lighting to enhance the disco ball’s effect.

4. **Connect the Sensors (Optional)**:
   - For an interactive dance floor, connect motion sensors or pressure sensors to your system. Place them on the floor where participants will be dancing.
   - Configure the sensors to trigger lighting effects when motion or pressure is detected.

5. **Software Configuration**:
   - Upload the code to your microcontroller. You’ll need code to handle the LED patterns, music synchronization, and sensor integration.
   - Install any necessary libraries for LED control and music processing (such as FastLED, Blynk, etc.).

6. **Test the System**:
   - Power up your **Solid Disco** setup and test each component: lights, music, sensors, and disco ball.
   - Adjust the settings through the mobile app or directly through the system to achieve the desired effects.
